## Development Guide (using Docker)

This section will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine using Docker. It is recommended to use Docker for development to ensure consistency across different environments.

1. Install Docker Desktop based on your operating system ([MAC](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) / [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) / [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)) and launch the application.

2. Clone this repository and move into the project directory where `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ntumods-org/ntumods-backend.git
    cd ntumods-backend
    ```

3. Install the server using Docker

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    Stop using `Ctrl+C`. Re-run this command when you want to start the server again in your local development environment. Your server should be up at `localhost:8000`. Migration should be done automatically when the server is started.

4. Load sample data

    ```bash
    docker exec -ti ntumods_api python manage.py loaddata sample_data.json
    ```

    If this is the first time you are running the server, please execute this command to load sample data. This should allow you to login as superuser (admin) with the following credentials:
    - Username: `superuser`
    - Password: `123`

    You can execute other utility commands by running `docker exec -ti ntumods_api python manage.py <command>`, such as making migrations, executing tests, etc.
